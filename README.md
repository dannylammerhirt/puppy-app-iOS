This is an iOS app for all devices that displays videos from openpuppies.com.

The interface is designed to be very simple: the application picks a random video and plays it on loop. The user taps the screen to advance to the next random video, and the user can long-press the screen to display a dialogue that allows the user to save the video to the device camera roll.
